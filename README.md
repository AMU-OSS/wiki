# OSS Community @AMU

> We are a community of developers who love free software.

The OSS community aims at setting up/ developing an insight into the world of open source
software to university students, and hence in the process become a prominent face in 
contributing to the open source community which is spread all over the world. 
It seeks in providing a basic intuition to the candidates the working of an organisation
and develop a flavour of professionalism in them, which normally is very hard to gain.
